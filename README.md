# preactement

An amazing library that makes working with Preact and Web Components a joy.

This is a fork of [jahilldev/preactement-htmlslots](https://github.com/jahilldev/preactement-htmlslots), which seemed like a good place to start experimenting with the library.

My goals with this repo are:

- Experiement with Preact to power Web Components
- Convert the previous example to use CSS Modules
- Add Storybook
